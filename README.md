# Install from GitHub repository

At least two options:

1. Install using the `.tar.gz` of the project:

    ```
    pip install https://github.com/kaczmarj/minimal-setup.py-project/tarball/main
    ```

2. Install using `git` (requires `git` to be installed):

    ```
    pip install git+https://github.com/kaczmarj/minimal-setup.py-project
    ```
